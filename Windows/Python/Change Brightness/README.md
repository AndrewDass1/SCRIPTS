# Change Brightness
The "change_brightness.py" script asks the user for a number input between the range from 0 to 100, to change the brightness on a Windows computer. This is an alternative to accurately change the brightness without going to Settings and using the scroll bar. Keyboards do have brightness keys to quickly adjust the brightness but this method changes it the brightness by increments of 10. Once again, running this script can asks for any number within the brightness scale and immediately change the brightness.
